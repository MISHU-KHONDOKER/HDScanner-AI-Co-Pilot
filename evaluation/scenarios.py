"""M4 scenarios: what the customer types, how the virtual scanner is set up, and
what the run MUST end in (checked by evaluation/scoring.py against M1).

Every scenario is a short Customer-mode conversation. The customer never answers
anything except the question the co-pilot is allowed to ask ("Which slide?"), so
the model has to do the rest on its own - exactly what Customer mode promises.

`expect` keys (all optional):
  outcome          the end result of the scan tool: "OK" or a support code
  scans            how many scans the machine received
  stops            how many times the co-pilot stopped a scan by itself
  config_written   whether the live settings file may change
  good_xspeed      the X-speed in the good file at the end
  quality          the quality verdict of the scan (first batch, nothing confirmed yet:
                   "needs_customer" - the co-pilot must ask "Does this scan look right?")
  level            the escalation level of the result (2 = the customer can act, 3 = technician)
  reference_saved  whether a confirmed quality reference was saved (first batch)
  tools_called / tools_not_called   tools that must / must not have been used
  reply_has        words the customer must see (any one of each group)
  reply_lacks      words the customer must NOT see (a false claim)

Scenario keys besides `expect`: `loaded` (what is in each loader position, None =
empty) and `setup` (settings put in place first, as in the M3 scenarios).
